# DHMT_OpenGL
- Using libary OpenGL for math base. I'm base on c++ language program . I'm try to implement project for design computer graphics simple. 
- by using tranform, rotate, scale with matrix 2D,3D,4D. Support my Master. Huy Tran.
## How to use. 

- my project was setup complete. Just using some editor like visual studio c++. and upload form my github.com 
- step1: get link: https://github.com/duymanhdoan/DHMT_OpenGL.git
- step2: after that. select folder [opengl_demo](https://github.com/duymanhdoan/DHMT_OpenGL/tree/master/Day3/opengl_demo) 
- step3: rebuild your project. Your can add exist item main.cpp, fs.shader and vs.shader then run your project. 
- step4: you can copy file [main.cpp](https://github.com/duymanhdoan/DHMT_OpenGL/blob/master/Day3/opengl_demo/opengl_demo/main.cpp) file [fs.shader](https://github.com/duymanhdoan/DHMT_OpenGL/blob/master/BtvnDay3/fs.shader) and file [vs.shader](https://github.com/duymanhdoan/DHMT_OpenGL/blob/master/BtvnDay3/vs.shader) then add to project . 

Anyway. You can configuration the project follow change 3 file main.cpp, fs.shader and vs.shader in folder opengl_demo. 

- thank you!.
