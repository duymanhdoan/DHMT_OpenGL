# DHMT_OpenGL
- Using libary OpenGL for math base. I'm base on c++ language program . I'm try to implement project for design computer graphics simple. 
- by using tranform, rotate, scale with matrix 2D,3D,4D. Support my Master. Huy Tran.
## How to use. 

- my project was setup complete. Just using some editor like visual studio c++. and upload form my github.com 
- step1: get link: [here](https://github.com/duymanhdoan/DHMT_OpenGL.git)
- step2: after that. select folder [opengl_demo](https://github.com/duymanhdoan/DHMT_OpenGL/tree/master/Day3/opengl_demo) 
- step3: rebuild your project. Your can add exist item main.cpp, fs.shader and vs.shader then run your project. 
- step4: you can custom code what you want in file [main.cpp](https://github.com/duymanhdoan/DHMT_OpenGL/blob/master/Day3/opengl_demo/opengl_demo/main.cpp)

- thank you!.
